## Introduction

This project is an attempt at making an entire operating system from scratch. It is currently being written for the **RISC-V** architecture only and focused on 64-bit.

As of now, this project is relying heavily on an [already existing simple operating system called **xv6**](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv), for which was written a [book (PDF)](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2023/xv6/book-riscv-rev3.pdf) explaining how it works.

* `riscv64-unknown-elf` to compile, assemble and link
* `qemu-system-riscv64` to run
